# Vibration_Detection_and_Classification_Project

ENGIN 491/492 Senior Design Project

This project was a team collaboration between Augustus Standeven, Tyler McKean, Vulindsky Fanfan, and Yohannes Kidane.

The goal of this project was to create a vibration-based security system that can capture and classify vibration signals and display information to a GUI for user operation. This was our senior design project as well as a Capstone Marketplace project with assitance from Professor Tomas Materdey from the University of Massachusetts Boston and Captain William Shepherd from the Stevens Institute of Technology.

Augustus helped with many different sections of the project. As one of the Senior EE students in the project, he helped conduct the initial research and design of the project from the starting phases. Augustus worked extensively on the vibration data acquisition, system design and implementation, design validation tests, project budgeting, and Python coding. For the Python coding, he specifically helped create and implement the data acquisition code, the machine learning algorithm, and the master script. Augustus was also in charge of the projectâ€™s CAD model, writing the final paper, and scheduling weekly zoom meetings with the team and CM/TM.
